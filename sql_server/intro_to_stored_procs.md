## Intro to Stored Procedures
In this lecture we're going to learn how to persist SQL Server Queries to be executed on demand. First we need to get some data into the Address table. What better method than to start off with a challenge.

## Challenge No. 1
Import 25 address records using Random User API.

Hint:
* Review [SQL Server Table Join Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqNirtQsz88&t=25)
* Mac Users - You can also review [Bulk Import using Azure Data Studio](https://youtu.be/pKjB_ScRksY)
* Windows Users - you can also review [Bulk Import using SSMS](https://youtu.be/Xyoszy-ZjbI)
* You can choose which method to use for importing data into your table
* Change the Query Parameter to include only location

## Challenge No. 2
Once you have imported those records, let's make sure the data imported correctly. Write `SELECT` Statements with a `JOIN` to display all 25 rows of data containing information from the `Person` and `Address` tables.
