# Creating Branch
Make sure you're in the terminal when running these commands.

## Clone
**Note:** The clone command is only ran once to copy the repo to your local machine. Skip this section if you have already cloned the repo.

If you do not have the repo locally on your machine follow these steps:
1. In the terminal, change into the directory where you want to create the folder for the repo
   1. Type: git clone <insert url here>

## Creating A New Branch
1. Start a new branch from the master branch
   1. Type: git checkout master
1. Get the latest changes from the master
   1. Type: git pull
1. Create & checkout the branch all in one command
   1. Type: git checkout -b <first.last/feature_name>
   1. e.g. git checkout victor.campos/login

Enjoy coding on your new branch!
