# Sprints for Mac OS for Development
**Sprint #1 (Approx. 2 hours)**
1. [Installing Git on your machine](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
   1. After you complete the installation follow along with the video I created for Windows on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/9vGEInAqHZs). This video contains important information about the Git Flow for cloning, branching, committing and merging.
1. [Installing SQL Server on your machine](https://database.guide/how-to-install-sql-server-on-a-mac/)
   1. [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVNWRYPv78o)
1. [Challenges](git_challenges.md)

## Creating an account on https://www.github.com
1. You can watch this on creating an account on Github

## Git Workflow
In this lecture you will learn about Git and it's workflow.

1. Clone
1. Branching
1. Committing your changes
1. Pushing to Github
1. Performing a Pull-Request
1. Pull changes from Github
1. You can watch the lecture to learn more about the workflow

## Challenge No. 1
Once you have completed the lecture take some time to complete the following challenges:

1. Create a repo on Github called `datascripts`
1. Add a ReadMe file
1. Make it private
1. Clone it to your machine
1. Modify the ReadMe file
   1. Make sure you follow the proper workflow as demo'd in the video
   
You goal is to try to accomplish this from memory. Try not to follow the video again. Instead browse the [Git Cheat Sheet](cheatsheets/git.md) and [Terminal Cheat Sheet](cheatsheets/terminal.md) to jog your brain.

Hints for Google Search:
* how do I clone a repo in git
* how do I commit my changes in git
* how do I create a branch in git
* how do I push my changes to Github
* how do I perform a pull request on Github

You'll need this repository to move on to the next lecture. Good luck!

## Challenge No. 2
Once you have completed the first challenge continue with white boarding. You can white board on an actual white board, a window with erasable markers, or a notepad (pen and paper).

### The importance of being able to white board:
1. Increase memory capacity of what you have learned
1. Increases the understanding of the technology
1. Increases self-reliance instead of using notes, cheat-sheets and Google
1. Most importantly, during technical interviews there won't be any computers available therefore you'll need to rely on memory to write the syntax on an actual whiteboard.

### Here's what you need to white board (don't cheat! try to do this from memory):
* Clone the repo from Github to your local machine
* Create a feature branch from the master branch
* Commit your changes include a comment
* Push your changes to Github

If you find yourself struggling feel free to review the videos as many times as you need to. The goal is to be able to complete the challenges without any help and strictly from memory.
