# Open Source Bootcamp
Disrupting the Coding Bootcamp Industry - The only free and opensource coding bootcamp for become a Full-Stack Developer!

## The Purpose
There are many methods of learning software development that are "free". Some are free to start but you have to eventually pay. Others are free but the information is scattered and there is no real curriculum to follow.

The purpose of creating the Opensource Bootcamp was to set out a very specific goal with an outlined curriculum. A curriculum that is well written, easy to follow yet challenging.
