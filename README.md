# Open Source Bootcamp
Disrupting the Coding Bootcamp Industry - The only free and opensource coding bootcamp for become a Full-Stack Developer!

## The Purpose
There are many methods of learning software development that are "free". Some are free to start but you have to eventually pay. Others are free but the information is scattered and there is no real curriculum to follow. Of course you can still learn from these sources but if you have a passion and no guidance the result will be a frustrated individual that will eventually throw in the towel.

If you're are the frustrated individual that is ready to throw in the towel you've come to the right place! Keep reading because you won't regret it. However, if you're the individual who is just getting started then you have saved yourself countless hours of aimless searching and scattered learning.

The purpose of creating the Opensource Bootcamp was to set out a very specific goal with an outlined curriculum. A curriculum that is well written, easy to follow yet challenging.
