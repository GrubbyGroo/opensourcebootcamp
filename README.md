# Open Source Bootcamp
Disrupting the Coding Bootcamp Industry - The only free and opensource coding bootcamp for become a Full-Stack Developer!

## The Purpose
There are many methods of learning software development that are "free". Some are free to start but you have to eventually pay. Others are free but the information is scattered and there is no real curriculum to follow. Of course you can still learn from these sources but if you have a passion and no guidance the result will be a frustrated individual that will eventually throw in the towel. Or worse! They go pay $10 of thousands for a bootcamp that will train them by pushing challenges with worthless lectures and little to no guidance. The best guidance they get is the famous verb: **"Google it!"**

If you're are the frustrated individual that is ready to throw in the towel you've come to the right place! Keep reading because you won't regret it. However, if you're the individual who is just getting started then you have saved yourself countless hours of aimless searching and scattered learning.

The purpose of creating the Opensource Bootcamp was to set out a very specific goal with an outlined curriculum. A curriculum that is well written, easy to follow yet challenging.

## The Analogy
Software is harmless yet it can do a lot of damage is used incorrectly. Learning industry standards are very important. 

This is the reason driver's license are issued in several countries to those who drive vehicles. Driving a car is almost a necessity in some parts of the world. Learning the rules of the road when operating a vehicle is important. Having more than one individual on the road operating a piece of machinery that weighs over 2,000lbs (453kg) can be dangerous if everyone is not following the same rules.

Another analogy is learning how to shoot a gun. This is a far fetched analogy but bare for a moment a gun in the hands of an amature. An amature can eventually figure out how to shoot a gun. However, imagine yourself watching this individual thru the eye of a camera as they are looking, prying, poking and pulling the different parts of the gun. If the individual figures out how to shoot it properly without injuring himself or others the individual can go to become one of the greatest marksmen in history. Consider the alternative where he shoots himself or someone else on accident.

Now consider you're in the military where you are asked to shoot and hit a target. I don't think I've ever heard a story where military personnel have been given a gun and asked to figure out how to shoot the weapon let alone hit a target. In fact, I heard otherwise. Military personnel are trained not only to shoot a weapon but also to disassemble it, clean it, reassemble it and secure it for safety.

Thankfully we're not dealing with anything as dangerous. However, if you're looking to improve your career or change your line of work in the most efficient manner getting the proper guidance is of most importance.
