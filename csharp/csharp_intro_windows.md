## Challenge No. 1
Find the range each type of integer:
1. Write a console application where you output the smallest int and uint, write the values out to the console.
1. Write a console application where you output the smallest long and ulong, write the values out to the console.

## Challenge No. 1
Re-write the following using unary expressions (write the values out to the console):
1. int i = j + 1 // let j = 10 (what is the value of i?)
1. int i = j - 1 // let j = 5 (what is the value of i?)

## Challenge No. 2
Using binary expressions, rewrite the following (write the values out to the console):
1. i = i + j // let i = 10, j = 5 (what is the value of i?)
1. i = i - j // let i = 10, j = 5 (what is the value of i?)
1. i = i * j // let i = 10, j = 5 (what is the value of i?)
1. i = i / j // let i = 10, j = 5 (what is the value of i?)
1. i = i % j // let i = 11, j = 2 (what is the value of i? what operator is the %? what is it used for?)

## Challenge No. 3
How can you figure out if any given number is an odd or an even number? Write a console application demonstrating this. Write the value to the console.
